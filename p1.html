            <h3>BASIC HOW TO MANAGE MONTHLY EXPENSES FOR LAZY PEOPLE</h3>
            <h5><b>5 steps to get your personal finances together, </b><span class="w3-opacity">January 19, 2019</span></h5>

            <p>Let me tell you, I am probably the laziest person on this planet. OK, I may be exaggerating, but I try living my life reaping maximum rewards for the least amount of effort.</p>

            <p>I am going to share with you how I manage my monthly expenses with the least amount of effort.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, the key to healthy finances is not a high salary, it’s knowing how to manage your expenses. Having steady income does really help.</p>

            <p>I moved out of my parents’ house at 25 years old and I didn’t really think my decision through. I did it on a whim and figured “meh, I’ll have enough to make it through”. The first year was a little rough, but I have learned a lot. I can finally say that, today, I am living VERY comfortably.</p>

            <p class="cap"><b>Background</b></p>
            <p>Before I give out my tips to managing monthly expenses for lazy people, it’s important I share some background information. That way, you can benchmark your situation to mine.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>I pay my rent 100% alone.</li>
              <li>I do not own a new car. I have an old ugly car that I purchased 3 ½ years ago for about $2,000.</li>
              <li>I don’t have cable at home. I have Netflix and Spotify subscriptions. I have to admit that I am a cheater because I sometimes use my parent’s cable subscription login information to watch television shows. However, I only do it very occasionally.</li>
              <li>I just finished paying off my student loan.</li>
              <li>I don’t have any kids.</li>
              <li>My job offers a pension plan.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="cap"><b>A lazy person’s guide to managing monthly expenses</b></p>

            <p><b>Step 1  - Set up a bank account & download the app</b></p>

            <p>It goes without saying, but set up a bank account and download your bank’s app on your smartphone. It makes it so much easier not be lazy. You can manage your account from your bed, from the toilet and from pretty much anywhere. Also, if you have an iPhone, you can log into your account with your fingerprints without having to type anything.</p>

            <p><b>Step 2 - Learn your card numbers by heart</b></p>

            <p>In the past, do you know have many times I have put off paying a bill or making an online transaction because my bank card was too far away in my bag sitting right next to my bed. Now, I know my credit card and debit card numbers by HEART! When I want to make a payment I not longer have to go get my bag and retrieve my card.</p>

            <p>Generally the length of the card number is a multiple of 4, with about 12 to 16 digits. If it makes it easier, learn your card digits in groups of 4 at a time.</p>

            <p><b>Step 3 - Set up a savings account with the click of a button</b></p>

            <p>Apart from your checking account, you need a savings account. The set up, is very easy. Usually, you’re bank’s app allows you to open a low interest savings account with just a few clicks (without meeting or talking to one of the bank’s advisors). Keep in mind that this is a basic guide, so I won’t teach you how to invest. However, the least you can do is put money aside. In later steps, I will explain how to use this savings account.</p>

            <p><b>Step 4 - Automate your bill payments - MOST IMPORTANT STEP</b></p>

            <p>As soon as I get paid, my bills get paid. Using the app, I set up all my monthly expenses as automatic recurring payment.</p>

            <p>I get paid every 2 weeks, meaning I generally have 2 paychecks per month. I use the first paycheck to pay all of my recurring bills and the second paycheck for rent. Also, I setup an automatic payment to my investment account that is withdrawn every time I get paid. Lastly, I put any excess cash into my savings account.</p>

            <p>Here is a list of my monthly recurring expenses (other than rent):</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Internet</li>
              <li>Cellphone</li>
              <li>Electricity</li>
              <p>In my province, consumers can choose to make equal monthly payments based on an estimated annual electricity consumption. At the end of the 12 month cycle, the electric company determines whether you have over utilized or underutilized electricity based on the estimate. If you have have used more electricity than their estimate, they will spread the short-payment over the next 12 months.</p>
              <p>I choose the equalized payments plan because I am a strong advocate of steady cash flows. It’s easier to plan and if you are lazy like me, you don’t need to assess every month how much you have to pay sinc the amount is the same every month.</p>  
              <li>Insurance (car and housing)</li>
              <p>As previously explained, I am a strong advocate of steady cash flows. I don’t pay a lump, I prefer spreading the payment monthly.</p>
              <li>License plate</li>
              <p>Refer to insurance above.</p>
              <li>Student debt</li>
              <p>I no longer have student debt. When I did, I made monthly payments that were high enough to reduce my balance, but low enough to have sufficient breathing room. I have to say that my regret is not paying off my balance before moving out of my parent’s house. The silver lining is that I wasn’t making frivolous purchases because I had my student loan to pay back.</p>
              <li>Credit card bill</li>
              <p>Other than the previously listed expenses, I pay everything with my credit card (food, gaz, toiletries, etc.). If you pay your credit card balance in full before the deadline, YOU WILL NOT PAY INTEREST. Also, credit cards, usually have incentive programs: cash back, reward points, miles, etc. If you are disciplined, using a credit card can get you free financing and free rewards.</p>
              <p>My credit card balance is the only expense I cannot set up automatically because the amount varies month to month. However, it’s still easy to pay because I receive an email disclosing the amount payable when the statement is ready.</p>
              <p>If you have no self control forget what I just said. You maximize your benefits when you pay it in full. Credit cards usually have higher interest rates. If you want a lower interest rate, you might want to consider getting a line of credit.</p>
              <li>Netflix, Spotify and iCloud</li>
              <p>I paid to increase the iCloud storage, for peace of mind. I was tired of seeing that my phone had not been backup in 267 weeks. In the grand scheme of things $1.50 per month [$18 / year] is not that big of a deal I guess.</p>
              <li>Savings / Investments</li>
              <p>I treat savings like a mandatory expense. Every pay day, a fixed amount is automatically withdrawn and goes to my investment account. Furthermore, once all my recurring monthly expenses have been paid, using the bank’s app, I transfer all my excess cash into the previously mentioned savings account. I try to leave a really low cash balance in my chequing account in case of emergency or if I have to pay something that is cash only.</p>
              <p>I treat my savings account and investment account as untouchable. Once the money is there, can’t touch it. I have to admit that a few months into getting my apartment, I had to dig into my savings when things got a little out of control.</p>
              <p>It’s almost become a game now. I feel so proud when I transfer a large amount into my savings account. It means that I’ve been good for the month. I also feel a little guilty when I see that I have spent so much money in the month that I have barely anything left for my savings.</p>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Other considerations</u></p>
            <p><i>a) Pay immediately - don’t wait until the bill’s due date</i></p>
            <p>Even if my pay day falls on February 13 and my bill is only due on February 25, I pay the bill immediately on pay day. I don’t wait for the due date to come. This is advantageous for many reasons:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>You avoid making late payments.</li>
              <li>You can better plan your excess cash flows for the month since your bills have all been paid.</li>
              <li>Between your pay day and the bill’s due date, you won’t magically find new income. So you might as well make the payment now. That way you are sure not to accidentally spend that money on something else.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>b) Adjust the automatic payment dates</i></p>
            <p>When I set up an automatic payment for my bills, I have to pick the monthly option since there is no 4 week option. Because I get paid every 2 weeks, the monthly option does not align perfectly with my paychecks. As such, every other paycheck I have to manually change the bill payment date so it falls on the next 4th week rather than the next month.</p>

            <p><i>c) Control your finances - avoid pre authorized withdrawals</i></p>
            <p>Service providers (e.g. cell phone companies, cable companies) give you the option of making pre authorized withdrawals from your credit card. This option could be easier for some (rather than setting up an automatic payment in your checking account). I do not use this option, because I want to retain control. Setting up the payments in my checking account allows me to have a list of all the expenses that are coming. Also, this allows me to validate the accuracy of the amount before it’s submitted.</p>

            <p><i>d) Consider other expenses</i></p>
            <p>You still have one time expenses that can come about. For example, driver’s license, one time big ticket items, car repairs, events etc. You have to factor those in your budget as well. To stay on top of things, as soon as I receive the bill, I usually set up an automatic payment for a future date for one time expenses like driver’s license or a parking ticket.</p>


            <p><b>Step 5 - Set up email notifications for your bills and set up emails on your phone</b></p>

            <p>Everytime a bill is ready (cellphone, electricity, internet, credit card), I receive an email notification. This allows me to quickly look at the amount due and determine if it make sense compared to my expectations and the auto payment programmed in my bank account. For example, I travelled to the U.S. for labour day weekend. When I received the email notification that my cell phone bill was ready, the amount was higher than what I usually pay. I knew right away that it was long distance charges. As such, I made a one time payment for the difference.</p>
            <p>The email also acts as a sanity check. My internet provider decided to increase my monthly fee for no reason. I was able to catch it because, in the email, I saw that the amount was $15 higher than the usual. I am no longer with this company.</p>
            <p>Also make sure you receive your emails directly on your cell phone. Once again, if you are lazy like me, you don’t want to constantly log into your email account.</p>
             

            <p class="cap"><b>Concluding notes</b></p>
            <p>Everyone is so stressed about having a budget. Using the aforementioned steps, you lowkey have a budget. Just after a couple of months, you can gage how much cash you have left over after all expenses have been paid. I choose not to be the person who closely monitors my every expenditures. If I want to go out for drinks tonight, I will. If I wants to buy a pair of shoes today, I will. I don’t want to be anxious, but I do use my judgement. If my credit card statement of the current month is twice the amount of the previous month, I know there is a problem and I will cut back on expenses the following month.</p>

            <p>Try not to live beyond your means. Don’t restrict yourself to the point of being miserable, be reasonable. Do you really need that expensive car or that 50th purse? Personally, my rent is expensive, but the tradeoff is that I don’t have a spanking brand new car.</p>

            <p>Here are the key takeaways: if you are a lazy person, automate automate automate. Download the bank’s app, set up automatic bill payments and set up email notifications for when your bills are ready.</p>
